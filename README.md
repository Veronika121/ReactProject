<h1>React Project: Find the sound</h1>

**Must have:**
<br>• the user can input some word and get a corresponding list of sounds.
<br>• the user can click on some item in this list and go to another page where the information about this sound is performed.
<br>• the user can listen to this sound.
<br>• the user can go back to the search results list and select another sound from that list.

**Nice to have:**
<br>• the user can see visualization of the sound.
<br>• the user can find similar sounds to a given target.
